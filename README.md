It is a graphic project based on object-oriented programming, which allows you to draw on a white board or any image in different colors and sizes.
  The capabilities of the project:
1. Drawing in different colors and sizes, and erasing.
2. Canceling, restoring, and cleaning the board.
3. Zoom in and out, and display the current board dimensions.
4. Drawing different shapes and text in different colors.
5. Cutting parts of the picture and pasting them elsewhere on the board.
6. Saving the work on the computer, and importing an image to the board from a file or api.

Important note: in order to use the api, the key of the api must be replaced with your own key by pre-registering for Unsplash.
